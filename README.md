# MultiGame is a Python program that so far has three game buttons; one for a number guessing game, one for a rock, paper, scissors game, and one for a fun fact quiz game. 
# The next two games to be added are: Create a Shape and Tic-Tac-Toe
# For each button that you click, a new window will pop up, playing that specific game on that specific window. The program is unfinished, as there are still functions to create 
# and actions between windows to be solved. 
# Overall, each game window has a similar structure concerning the start game and back to menu buttons, and updating the text of the first set of directions,
# but differ in the actual function of each game.
